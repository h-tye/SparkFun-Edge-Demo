# SparkFun-Edge-Demo
A tutorial on the steps necessary to take your own code to the board. Considering the support for this board is far from optimal, I figured someone should provide an outline to work with.
I generated 3 different approaches to flashing binary onto the SparkFun Edge. Only the 1st approach was successful for me but maybe you'll have better luck.
